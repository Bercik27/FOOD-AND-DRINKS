###  The world's weirdest food
    It is tough to say which food is strange or normal, because it all depends on taste. 
 For one person some type of meal can be  inedible and for another it can be best  food ever
 we can surly say that some kind of meals are untypical. Especially from exotic from our perspective countries.
   #  HAGIS
Foe example hagis- a scotish dish that contains a parts of sheep that many people would throw away. The heart
lungs and liver are mixed together with onion spieces and oatmeal, then put inside a asheep's stomach and mixed inside.
  #Hakarl
